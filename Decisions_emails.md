Email verification in Pilot2
=====

Verifying that your email address is live and belongs to you is now a familiar process to most people. Many sites send an email with a verification button or link as part of activating an account.

# Email verification prevents submissions by bots 

We believe that the email verification step will significantly reduce the fraudulent use of names because bots cannot simply create submissions that are not matched with live email accounts, and that are submitted all at once.

# Preventing organization-name fraud 

For third party organizations, analysts will be able to compare the submitter’s email address with the organization name to do some fraud prevention. 

* For example, if the Organization name on the submission is the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, then the analyst could check that the submitter’s email address domain is cfib.ca 

# Supporting stakeholders in editing submissions over time

Once email verification is set up, it provides a way to work on a submission over a long period of time. A different email can be generated with a link that acts as a tracking link. People can use the link from any browser to work on their submission until the end of the consultation period.

# Proposal 

Comment submissions will not be accepted unless they are verified/confirmed via an active email account. No exceptions - if they skip the verify action, the submission is not accepted into the database.
